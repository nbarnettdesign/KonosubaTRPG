# God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! TRPG

You, reading this book right now, have probably read ‘God&#39;s Blessing on this Wonderful World!’, and have picked up this book
thinking it’s a related publication. Or, you’ve already played various “TRPGs”, and reached out your hand thinking it’s a new
TRPG.

And you wouldn’t be wrong either way.
That’s because this book is a new TRPG (tabletop role-playing game) which uses ‘God&#39;s Blessing on this Wonderful World!’
(‘Konosuba’ below), sold by Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko.

#### What is a TRPG?

The GM prepares the scenario that will be played, and each player is in charge of a Player Character (Shortened to PC below) , 
a character that exists in the game world.

The basic flow of a TRPG is as follows.
The GM uses a prepared scenario, and explains just what kind of situation the PCs are in. The players then think about the
decisions and actions their PC would make, and then tells that too the GM.

The GM then compares that to the current situation, decides the outcome of the PC’s action, and tells the newly born situation
that arose from that action to the players (By using the rules, data, and such recorded in this book, the actions of PCs can
succeed or fail).

There is no winning or losing a TRPG. But, if you really want to know how to achieve victory, it would probably be when all the
participants including the GM are having fun.
There may be times when your PC ends up dying. There may also be times when the adventure doesn’t go well. However, if you’re able to enjoy the story, that’s victory. A game where you enjoy creating stories with your friends --- that’s a TRPG.

#### What is ‘God's Blessing on this Wonderful World!'?
In ‘Konosuba TRPG’, players become adventurers in the ‘Konosuba’ world, and complete requests (Quests) from the adventurer’s
guild, like monster slaying or dungeon exploration. Adventurers are split into various “Classes” like the knight, who fights with
weapons, or the wizard, who fights with magic.

#### What you need to play 'Konosuba TRPG'
In order to play ‘Konosuba TRPG’, you need to prepare several things
- **Participants** - In order to play ‘Konosuba TRPG’, a GM plus several people (about 3~5) are required.

- **Six Sided Dice** - Each person should have around 3~5 dice prepared. Depending on the situation, more than 10 may be required, so the GM
should have many prepared so they aren’t in trouble when the time comes.

- ** Writing impliments ** - Writing Implements include things like pencils and mechanical pencils, which can be erased by an eraser. Of course, this is
required for all participants. The GM also needs red, and black ballpoint pens.

- ** Rulebook** - This book. Each player should have a rulebook if possible, in order for easy referencing of data and such.

- ** Character Sheets** - One for Each Player

- ** Record Sheets and Session Sheets**

## What Makes a Character
In order to play ‘Konosuba TRPG’, you must create a player character (PC). The PC you create is an adventurer in the world of ‘Konosuba’. That PC is your alter ego, and along with the PC’s the other players have made in the same way, you go on various adventures. 

PC’s have several attributes that represent their physical and mental strength, abilities you take called skills, and equipped weapons or armor, each represented by data. 

Creating a PC is nothing other than deciding what this data should be. However, PC’s aren’t represented from just this numerical data. 

Settings like name, sex, age, lineage or experiences are also
included, forming a single character.

For that, we’ll first explain the order for forming a PC.

### Race
In the base rulebook of ‘Konosuba TRPG’, you can choose one race from three races.


- A **“Reincarnated”**, who died in the real world of earth, and was reincarnated into the world of ‘Konosuba’ from a goddesses power.


- A **“Native”**, who was born in and lives in the world of ‘Konosuba’.


- And a **“Crimson Demon”**, a race with magical power.

Things like the PC’s outward appearing features, and innate abilities are decided by race. Also, each race has different aptitudes
for the below-mentioned classes, so you should probably think about classes as well, when selecting a race. Descriptions for each race are written under 'Races' below, so you should use that as a reference.

---

### Class
That which represents a PC’s role is a 【Class】, like the knight who uses a sword to fight, the priest who uses healing magic, and the wizard who uses offensive magic. PC’s must pick one class.

---
### Ability Score
Just like in the real world, the people of ‘Konosuba’ also have strong people, weak people, dexteritous people, clumsy people, and such, with each person having their own characteristics.

【Ability scores】are the data that represents those physical and mental fortes and weaknesses. Ability scores are divided into the seven categories of【Strength】,【Dexterity】,【Agility】,【Intelligence】,【Perception】,【Spirit】,and【Luck】

Each have their own value. The minimum value is zero, and there is no maximum value. The higher this value, the more you excel in the field related to the ability score. Each kind of ability score and their meanings are as follows:

----

**Strength:** Represents things like how strong the character is, how tough their muscles are, and how high their physical fitness is. This includes: 
- Determines the max value of HP

- Have knowledge of things like topography, history, past incidents, special technologies or other areas of study.
- Used in magic checks and enemy identification

**Perception:** Represents how sharp a character’s senses are. Not limited to just the five senses, but also includes things like inspirations like a sixth sense, and premonitions.

### Skills
If ability scores are the basic capabilities of a character, then【Skills】are things characters have like talent and techniques
made into data. For example,【Movement skill】 represents a high movement capability, and 【Weapon skill】 represents proficiency in the use of weapons.

---
These are split into 【Race skills】, which are skills set by race,【Class skills】, which are set by class, and 【General skills】, which can be obtained independent of class. Other than those, there are 【Enemy skills】, which are obtained by the PCs’ enemies.

---
When Creating a character, you selet **ONE** skill that is under Creation for your race.
### Items

The weapons and armor characters equip, and things like tools used in adventures are collectively called【Items】, and the items that a character possesses are called 【Possessions】. Possessions are split into three groups,
- 【Equipment】, which are things like weapons and armor that can be put on yourself
- 【Portables】, which can be put away into backpacks and pouches
- and those which are neither equipment nor portables.

-----
Characters can equip one item each to six possible locations,「Right hand」「Left hand」「Head」「Body」「Auxiliary armor」「Accessory」. The types of equipable items are ［Weapon］［Shield］［Armor］［Accessory］. The description for equip methods of weapons and shields differ.

### Personal Data
Personal data is data that is represented by character settings like their name, sex, age, and appearance, and things like the character’s origin and history, which is called their life path.

### Cheats
Cheats are things like special characteristics or special abilities of characters appearing in the original ‘Konosuba’ novel that have
been made into data.

By bringing in cheats, session developments can become flashier, and unpredictable. At the same time, there is a chance of
session progress breaking down.

If the GM gives permission, PC’s can obtain cheats.

### Secondary Ability Scores
【Secondary ability scores】 are special ability scores found from things like your ability score and equipment. Mainly used during
combat.

##### HP
［HP］ is a number that represents a character’s physical endurance. Called “Life force” in the original work.
By receiving attacks from things like weapons, magic, or getting caught in traps, whenever characters are injured, fatigued, or
such, HP is reduced. Furthermore, HP has no minimum value, and may become negative.
```
```
##### Max HP
What you decide during character creation is your HP’s maximum value. This is called ［Max HP］. HP reduced from damage can
be restored in various ways, but you cannot exceed your max HP. You can find your max HP by using the following formula.
Record this number in the HP section of your character sheet.

##### MP
［MP］is a number that represents the power used for magic and skills. Called “Magical power” in the original work. Mainly decreases through use of skills. Unlike HP, the minimum value of MP is zero, and it cannot become negative.

how fast you can act. 

##### Movement Ability
【Movement ability】 is a secondary ability score that represents how far a character move in battle, and such, with units in
meters. You can find your【Movement ability】 by using the following formula. The minimum value for 【Movement ability】 is
zero. If your 【Movement ability】 ever becomes zero, you cannot move anywhere.

### Blessings
A 【Blessing】is a power that defies fate, or makes it your ally. With this power, you can do things that produce great successes,
like producing results above your actual abilities, or dealing an even heavier blow.

【Blessings】 are the PCs hidden powers, the power to rewrite fate.
-Additional Dice: Right before a dice roll, increase your dice by 1 for every spent 【Blessing】point (To a
maximum of your 【Luck】score).

## Classes

#### Base Class
Decide the character’s class. Each character has one class.

A class represents things like abilities and role in battle. For example, a knight stands at the front lines dealing heavy blows to the enemy, 

while a wizard is responsible for staying back and attacking with magic. A priest heals and supports their party. Each class has a different fighting style.
What you should do in-game is dependent on your chosen class. Choose one of the 12 classes, and record in the class section of your character sheet.

#### Knight
Even among adventurers, the knight is a class many are engaged in. They are widely depended on as the party’s sword and shield in brawls, and are expected to serve the most use in requests like monster slaying. 

On the other hand, they are heavily reliant on their sword and shield for that offense and defense. In order to completely unleash their power in battle, it’s imperative they buy things like weapons and armor of good quality that matches their current self (Level).


#### Priest
A priest is a class that causes various miracles through the power of their faith. Responsible for the party’s healing and support. 

Because it’s so important, every party wants one. Opposed to that importance is the fact that few priests choose the dangerous path of the adventurer. That’s why even in the adventurer’s guild, priests are in huge demand, and are pampered to the same degree. 
There are even nefarious priests who take advantage of their occupation’s popularity by hopping between parties while milking them for all they’re worth. 

In this world, the majority belong to the Eris Church, which worships the goddess Eris.

#### Wizard
The wizard is a class that manipulates magic, often treated as the brains of the party. That’s because magic and academics are widely considered as if the same thing, with many wizards taking higher education.

It’s not unusual for doctors, or even national positions like government officials and tacticians to be done by wizards. But, talent is also important for manipulating magic. On this point, wizards from the crimson demon clan are well known for their excellence. 

Wizards are a relatively rare class among adventurers, and it’s not uncommon for parties to not have one.

#### Thief
The thief is the second most seen class among adventurers, following the knight. Like the knight, it’s a class that is used for offense in battles. 

Where the thief’s features most prominently appear is in dungeon exploration. A thief’s skills are absolutely essential for dealing with things like dangerous traps or mechanisms installed in dungeons. 

They also have many skills relating to covert movement, and could be thought of as a class that the party can depend on to do a wide range of duties. 

Among the class skill, there are many that expand what you can do just by having them. It’s a class whose skills greatly influence your character when acquired.

#### Adventurer
An adventurer is a class with no entry requirements for those who couldn’t pick any other class, or chose not to . 

Adventurers can take class skills from other classes. Because of this, it can be thought of as a class aimed at experts. In essence, picking from the skills of all the base classes, you need both the knowledge of choosing the data you need yourself, and the sense to choose skills needed among your party members. 

\page

#### Archer
Archers are a class that excel at using bows. It’s possible for them to snipe weak points and such without getting close to enemies. 

#### Elemental Master
The elemental master is a class that strengthens elemental powers by calling forth spirits. 

Because of that specialty, if there’s no way to use the power of the elements, most of the skills are meaningless. 

#### Creator
The creator is a class that fights using “Magic circle” traps brought forth by magic. 

The magic circles can create gaps in enemy defense, or inflict a desired ailment. 

#### Swordsman
The swordsman is a class that excels at using all kinds of swords, like short blades, long blades, and two-handed swords. 

Once they have a sword in hand, they could probably cut down any kind of enemy with ease.

#### Sworn Knight
Like the knight, the sword knight is class that represents the proud. They can raise their own power through honor and oaths. 

#### Lancer
The lancer is a class that uses spears to fight. They can utilize their long reach to stop enemies in their tracks, or use an assault’s momentum to increase their force and attack.

#### Rune Knight
A rune knight is a class that uses magic seals (Runes) to fight. 

They can do things like strengthen weapons or armor, or bring out the elemental power of treasure using seals.
